## Approach & Efficiency

I tried to start with the algorithm but the but I was having a hard time getting my bearing on what I was trying to do so I just coded it out and figured out and try to do my algorithm afterwards and I learned that thats not a good idea going into a interview. I tired so I am just gonna come back to this lab like the billions of things I also Have to do so yea I need to plan a day to get this work done.
